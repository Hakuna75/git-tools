.SH DESCRIPTION
Restore original modification time of files based on the date of the most
recent commit that modified them. Useful when generating release tarballs.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Positional arguments:
.TP 8
.I pathspec
only modify paths (dirs or files) matching PATHSPEC,
relative to current directory. Default is to modify
all non-ignored, tracked files.
.SS Optional arguments:
.TP 8
.BR \-h , \ \-\-help
show help message and exit
.TP 8
.BR \-\-quiet , \-q
suppress informative messages and summary statistics.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-verbose , \-v
print additional information for each processed file.
Overwrites --quiet.
.TP 8
.BI \-\-git-dir\  GITDIR
path to the git repository, by default auto-discovered
by git by searching the current directory and its parents
for a .git/ subfolder
.TP 8
.BI \-\-work-tree\  WORKDIR
path to the work tree root, by default the parent of GITDIR
if it was automatically discovered, or the current directory
if GITDIR was set.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-force , \-f
force execution on trees with uncommitted changes.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-merge , \-m
include merge commits. Leads to more recent mtimes and
more files per commit, thus with the same mtime (which
may or may not be what you want). Including merge
commits may lead to less commits being evaluated (all
files are found sooner), which improves performance,
sometimes substantially. But since merge commits are
usually huge, processing them may also take longer,
sometimes substantially. By default merge logs are
only used for files missing from regular commit logs.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-first-parent
pass --first-parent to git whatchanged to hide the
second parent from the merge commit logs. Only has any
effect if --merge is also specified or --skip-missing
is not specified and there were files not found in
regular commit logs.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-skip-missing , \-s
do not try to find missing files. If some files were
not found in regular commit logs, by default it
retries using merge commit logs for these files (if
--merge was not used already). This option disables
this behavior, which may slightly improve performance,
but files found only in merge commits will not be
updated.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-no-directories , \-D
do not update directory mtime for files created,
renamed or deleted in it. Note: just modifying a file
will not update its directory mtime.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-test , \-t
test run: do not actually update any file
.TP 8
.BR \-\-commit-time , \-c
use commit time instead of author time
.TP 8
.BR \-\-oldest-time , \-o
pass --reverse to git whatchanged, so that the commit
history for the current branch will be processed in
reverse order (i.e. from the oldest commit to the most
recent). This will result in a file's mtime being set
to the time of the oldest commit to reference that
file, instead of most recent. This option will not
work correctly on branches where multiple files have
been renamed with the same name.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-skip-older-than SECONDS
Do not modify files that are older than SECONDS.
It can significantly improve performance if fewer files
are processed. Useful on CI builds, which can eventually
switch workspace to different branch, but mostly performs
builds on the same one (e.g. master).
.TP 8
.BR \-\-unique-times
Set the microseconds to a unique value per commit.
It allows telling apart changes that would otherwise have
identical timestamps, as git has time accuracy in seconds.
